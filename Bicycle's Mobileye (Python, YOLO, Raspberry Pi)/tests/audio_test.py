Audio Testing Script

This script provides audio testing capabilities for the vehicle warning system, including
tone generation and audio file playback. It's used for testing audio output functionality.

Key Features:
- Sine wave tone generation at specified frequencies
- Melody playback (Twinkle Twinkle Little Star)
- Audio file playback with looping
- Volume control for testing
- Pygame mixer integration
- Error handling for audio device issues

Audio Functions:
- generate_tone(): Creates sine wave tones at specific frequencies
- play_melody(): Plays predefined melody sequences
- play_audio(): Loops audio file playback for testing

Usage:
    python audio_test.py

This script is used for:
- Testing audio hardware functionality
- Verifying warning system audio output
- Calibrating audio volume levels
- Debugging audio-related issues

The script supports both generated tones and pre-recorded audio files
for comprehensive audio system testing.
